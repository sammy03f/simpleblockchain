A straightforward blockchain implementation in Python that demonstrates the core concepts without being overly complex.

-Represents individual blocks with index, timestamp, data, previous hash, and nonce
-Manages the chain of blocks and provides validation
-Simple mining algorithm that finds hashes starting with a certain number of zeros
-Checks that all blocks are properly linked and have valid hashes
-Automatically creates the first block in the chain
